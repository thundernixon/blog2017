Built on top of [gatsby-blog-starter-kit](https://github.com/DSchau/gatsby-blog-starter-kit), because that had most of what I was looking for: 
1. Blog post listing with previews for each blog post
1. Navigation between posts with a previous/next post button
1. Tags and tag navigation
1. Responsive images (via [gatsby-remark-images][gatsby-remark-images])

I am currently deploying this via [Netlify](https://netlify.com) and I have been surprised at how painless the deploy experience has been so far.

## Set up

1. You can either clone this repo or start your own blog from [gatsby-blog-starter-kit](https://github.com/DSchau/gatsby-blog-starter-kit)
1. `yarn`
1. `yarn start`
