I won't be making a post to document _every_ week of TypeMedia, but because this was the first week of classes, I want to take the chance to record who is teaching, what we will be covering in the first semester, and a few of the lessons we receive in the first days here.

## Day 1, Monday

Teacher: Paul Van Der Laan
Main focus of course: research and process in type revival

### Revival project

- From now through December
- Finding a book printed before 1940 (so we can be confident it was printed with metal, movable type), and "reviving" that into a digital typeface
- This is about much more than just making a bunch of characters in the style of the type from the book. The bigger focus is on researching foundries, printers, and history. 
- Much of this information is not online, so it will force us into the libraries and archives around the Netherlands. Some of these include Museum Meermano and the Royal Archive in Den Haag, the Amsterdam University Library, and the Plantin Moretus in Antwerp. Some of us may even need to go to the Klingspor Archiv Offenback, in Germany.

> "You're in the Netherlands for a year. You'd be a fool to not take the opportunity to delve into archives."

- Next week, we will need to bring 1–3 books. We need to own these, because we will likely need to be a bit brutal with them – pushing them flat for scanning, and maybe even cutting out pages for closer analysis.

- We need to select a reading typeface, not something specific to captions or headlines. It should have a good character set.
- We will be expected to remake at least the upper and lower case, numerals, and punctuation. However, this is not about who can make the biggest character set. It's about research, having doubts, asking questions, and exploring our approach. 
- Good questions to ask are:
    - Who printed it? 
    - Who founded it? 
    - Are there original drawings?
    - What is the nationality/pedigree?
    - Did they base the design on something earlier? Were there similar contemporary designsc?
    - What recreations and adaptations have been made, since?

We will need to write an essay to document:
- Our complete process of digitization
- Our historical research on the background of the type

We will also need to create a printed specimen of our type.

Primary goal: establishing an archiving and research process. Paul uses Evernote, but we can explore other methods. (I am going to explore whether GitHub might work for something like this ... but are there other apps or systems I should be looking at?)

We will be evaluated on the content & execution of our essay and type specimen.

For the rest of the class, we enjoyed the incredible BBC documentary _The Machine that Made Us_, about Gutenberg, his printing press, and how it forever changed the world. The 58-minute film is [available on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8svE2AjQWYE), and if you're interested in type, design, books, and/or technology, it's a must-watch. Today, the printing press seems ancient, but Gutenberg wasn't so unlike a successful modern-day entrepreneur – he had a vision, but to achieve it he had to court venture capitalists for investment, create proofs of concept to show the church how the press could be usefully monetized, and toil for years to make something that went on to change the world "overnight." One staggering fact that shows how quickly the technology spread: just 50 years after Gutenberg printed his first bibles, Europe had _250 million_ printed books.

## Day 2, Tuesday

Teacher: Peter Verheul
Main focus of course: how type is influenced by writing and calligraphy

- _The Stroke_ by Gerrit Nordzij
    - Every letter is formed by a tool, and that informs its shape
    - translation vs expansion
    - running vs interupted (Grid)
    - "The Cube"
- Our final presentation will be based on one of these extremes
- This is about type design. These exercises are about _seeing_, more than about becoming experts in calligraphy
- There is also more-artistic calligraphy, but that is not the aim of this course. See [John Stevens](https://www.instagram.com/calligraphile/), [Luca Barcellona](https://www.instagram.com/lucabarcellona/), [Hermann Zapf](https://vimeo.com/5385464), and [Niels Shoe Meulman](https://www.instagram.com/nielsshoemeulman/)

- calligraphy exercises
    - proper brush & watercolor for calligraphy
    - straight lines, vertical and horizontal, with a brush held at 30°
    - n's and o's
- construction of roman, lowercase, translation alphabet
    - only a few components. shoulder (a, n, m, h), upright (b, d, i, j, l,), serif, bowl (b, c, d, g, o, p, q), angles (w, x, y, z)

> "Try to like what you are doing. Actually, forget about the word _try_. Like what you're doing, and it will show."
