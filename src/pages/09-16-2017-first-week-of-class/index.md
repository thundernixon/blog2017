# (Draft post)

We've finished the first two weeks of class in TypeMedia, and we now have a pretty good view of what this semester will be like â€“ and a very full plate of exciting, challenging projects.

In part because of how much work there already is to do, I won't be making posts to document most weeks of TypeMedia, but before I'm really in up to my eyeballs, I want to take the chance to record who is teaching, what we will be covering in the first semester, and a few of the lessons we received in the first days of class.

### But first, a quick story of personal mishap.

I love ice cream. One of the places I miss most in Brooklyn is [Ample Hills](https://www.amplehills.com/), with their incredible, additing, wacky ice cream flavors like _Ooey Gooey Butter Cake_ and the too-short-lived _Peanut Butter 4 President_ (they also have some very fun illustrations in their stores). 

You can imagine, then, how proud I was of myself to think of putting vanilla ice cream onto a [stroopwafel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroopwafel) to make a Dutch ice-cream sandwich.

Unfortunately, I also have two half-fake front teeth, due to tripping and smacking my mouth on concrete when I was about 8-years-old. They rarely chip, but I tend to avoid biting directly into hard foods like apples, without first cutting them and using my back teeth. Still, every once in awhile my front teeth just chip, anyway. As it turns out, a cold stroopwafel was too much for them, so as I was enjoying my invention the night before the first day of class... 

I felt the _crunch_ of a front tooth on a bite. 

Lesson learned: stroopwafel sandwiches are bad news. A slight upside: I've since learned that the mixture tastes better anyway if you break up the stroopwafel and mix it into ice cream â€“ it's more like an Ample Hills concoction, that way.

It's healthy to have [a periodic reminder to be humble](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvTRZJ-4EyI), right? I snagged a rare selfie on the first day of class, with my chipped tooth, because it felt like such perfectly poor timing. ðŸ‘¹

# TypeMedia classes, Semester 1

Our classes don't have formal names, but each teacher has a general area of focus, so we will have a well-rounded education this semester, and then go even deeper on an individual thesis project, next semester.

## Type Revival, with Paul Van Der Laan

**Main focus of course:** research and process in type revival

**Primary assignment:** 
1. Creating a typeface based on a font found in a book printed before 1940
2. Producing a report on the history of the typeface and our process in reviving it

### Revival project

- From now through December
- Finding a book printed before 1940 (so we can be confident it was printed with metal, movable type), and "reviving" that into a digital typeface
- This is about much more than just making a bunch of characters in the style of the type from the book. The bigger focus is on researching foundries, printers, and history. 
- Much of this information is not online, so it will force us into the libraries and archives around the Netherlands. Some of these include Museum Meermano and the Royal Archive in Den Haag, the Amsterdam University Library, and the Plantin Moretus in Antwerp. Some of us may even need to go to the Klingspor Archiv Offenback, in Germany.

> "You're in the Netherlands for a year. You'd be a fool to not take the opportunity to delve into archives."

- Next week, we will need to bring 1â€“3 books. We need to own these, because we will likely need to be a bit brutal with them â€“ pushing them flat for scanning, and maybe even cutting out pages for closer analysis.

- We need to select a reading typeface, not something specific to captions or headlines. It should have a good character set.
- We will be expected to remake at least the upper and lower case, numerals, and punctuation. However, this is not about who can make the biggest character set. It's about research, having doubts, asking questions, and exploring our approach. 
- Good questions to ask are:
    - Who printed it? 
    - Who founded it? 
    - Are there original drawings?
    - What is the nationality/pedigree?
    - Did they base the design on something earlier? Were there similar contemporary designsc?
    - What recreations and adaptations have been made, since?

We will need to write an essay to document:
- Our complete process of digitization
- Our historical research on the background of the type

We will also need to create a printed specimen of our type.

Primary goal: establishing an archiving and research process. Paul uses Evernote, but we can explore other methods. (I am going to explore whether GitHub might work for something like this ... but are there other apps or systems I should be looking at?)

We will be evaluated on the content & execution of our essay and type specimen.

For the rest of the class, we enjoyed the incredible BBC documentary _The Machine that Made Us_, about Gutenberg, his printing press, and how it forever changed the world. The 58-minute film is [available on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8svE2AjQWYE). If you're interested in type, design, books, and/or technology, it's a must-watch. Today, the printing press seems ancient, but Gutenberg wasn't so unlike a successful modern-day entrepreneur â€“ he had a vision, but to achieve it he had to court venture capitalists for investment, create proofs of concept to show the church how the press could be usefully monetized, and toil for years to make something that went on to change the world "overnight." One staggering fact that shows how quickly the technology spread: just 50 years after Gutenberg printed his first bibles, Europe had _250 million_ printed books.

## Calligraphy & Type, with Peter Verheul

**Main focus of course:** how type is influenced by writing and calligraphy

**Primary assignment:** creating a type family based on flat-brush calligraphy which will include 4 variations:
- A primary font, optimized for long-form reading
- A high-contrast variation (with a large amount of thick/thin contrast)
- A low-contrast (basically, a sans-serif or slab-serif)
- An informal (display) version of the primary font, made for short, attention-grabbing texts like book covers or posters

<img src="./images/2017-09-12-16.39.58.jpg" alt="Peter Verheul" />


- _The Stroke_ by Gerrit Nordzij
    - Every letter is formed by a tool, and that informs its shape
    - translation vs expansion
    - running vs interupted (Grid)
    - "The Cube"
- Our final presentation will be based on one of these extremes
- This is about type design. These exercises are about _seeing_, more than about becoming experts in calligraphy
- There is also more-artistic calligraphy, but that is not the aim of this course. See [John Stevens](https://www.instagram.com/calligraphile/), [Luca Barcellona](https://www.instagram.com/lucabarcellona/), [Hermann Zapf](https://vimeo.com/5385464), and [Niels Shoe Meulman](https://www.instagram.com/nielsshoemeulman/)

- calligraphy exercises
    - proper brush & watercolor for calligraphy
    - straight lines, vertical and horizontal, with a brush held at 30Â°
    - n's and o's
- construction of roman, lowercase, translation alphabet
    - only a few components. shoulder (a, n, m, h), upright (b, d, i, j, l,), serif, bowl (b, c, d, g, o, p, q), angles (w, x, y, z)

## Programming in Python, with Just Van Rossum

**Main focus of course:** introducing us to programming as a way to enhance and broaden our type design process

**Primary assignment:** creating an alphabet in Drawbot (though we are encouraged to also explore as deep as possible, with particular emphasis on creating tools to use in type design software such as Robofont)

<img src="./images/2017-09-13-09.54.48.jpg" alt="Paul Van Der Laan explains a type ornamentation process to a TypeMedia class" />

> That's what I love [about experimental design with scripting]. There are no mistakes, only happy little accidents. Keep track of your mistakes.

## Type design practice, with Erik Van Blokland

**Main focus of course:** This course will be the most varied, and is the only course that will happen in each semester. At the start, we will be working with pointed-pen calligraphy, but it seems like this course will be a wide-ranging series of lessons from Erik on type history, font editing, scripting, spacing, and personal practice.

**Main focus of course:** studying how Arabic languages are written, including the history of Arabic calligraphy and type design

**Primary assignment:** developing an Arabic script based on research and understanding of Arabic writing and calligraphy

The course is full time, and most of us spend full days at school, as much as the building's open hours will allow. I don't have photos to show for most of the highlights, because the best part is getting to learn with and from my classmates.

One thing that I did grab a few photos of is a somewhat magical thing that design schools are thankfully helping keep alive: letterpress printing.

_Wood type in the KABK collection._

In TypeMedia tradition, our class is making a set of small booklets with our monograms, printed one-per-page, and our contact details set in lead type on the final pages. In the first session, we set one of our initials in wood type, and in the next session, we will be overlaying the other initial with a letter we design and cut ourselves (via linocut, lasercut, or other methods). I cheated on the first round, and stacked two condensed **N**s to create one very-compressed N.

We are also settling into the classroom, and creating our workspaces. I should have brought a US keyboard along with me, but aside from the current lack of an external keyboard, I am pretty stoked on my setup.

Bonus: I found [a great dentist](http://thehaguedentalcare.nl/) who was able to repair my tooth. I was a bit nervous about seeing a dentist in a new country, but the experience at this particular was easy and painless.
