Quick: you need to add an emoji to an email/document/mockup – what do you do? What if you instead need to add a special character, like a ℉ or ® sign?

I used to reach for something like [Emojipedia](http://emojipedia.com) or [Amp-What](http://amp-what.com), then copy-and-paste from there. These are both still useful resources, but I’ve finally realized that macOS has a much faster, much simpler way to add symbols to text.


## The quick palette

The key command `control+command+spacebar` will pull up the macOS character palette. From here, it’s super fast to scroll or type to search for whatever emoji or special character you need. 😻

## The bigger palette

Nice, right? What’s more, if you click the little “view button” at the top right of the palette, you’ll get a little window which will make it even easier to browse for all the characters you can use. Amazing, right? Check out all the arrows you can use on a Mac!

## Typing accented characters

While writing about this character palette, I came across Apple’s support page about it. Turns out, there’s one more cool trick to type accented characters (without having to remember fancy modifier keys). In Apple's words:


> To type an accented or alternate version of a character, hold a key down until its alternate characters are displayed. 

So, next time you need an e-ogonek, just hold down the ‘e’ key, and either click the character or press the corresponding number key for the character you need.

Happy typing! ❦
