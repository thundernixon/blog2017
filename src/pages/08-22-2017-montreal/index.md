About a week before the July 4th holiday weekend, Celeste (my girlfriend) and I were discussing last-minute travel plans. We looked at airbnb listings up along the Hudson river. A calming vacation into the less-urban, hilly areas north of NYC was enticing. However, it would almost certainly require renting a car and driving on busy roads, and that would significantly reduce the "calming" factor of the trip. Plus, most things around there seemed either booked or more expensive than we wanted, so we started looking further afield.

"Mexico City?" I suggested. Celeste is adventurous, but this was shut down pretty quickly. ðŸ˜„ We didn't want to spend two days flying out of our four days off from work.

"Niagra Falls?" she suggested. I looked it up on Google Maps, and something caught my eye: Niagra Falls is about 7 hours away from NYC, and Montreal seemed to be about the same distance. I hadn't ever visited Montreal before, even though I have heard great things about it. Celeste was in the same position, so we agreed to give it a try. 

We made a good choice! Montreal is beautiful, and we had so much fun that it's on our list of places we'd be seriously interested in moving to in the future (though, we should probably visit in the winter before we sign any leases or job offers).

We lucked out, and ended up visiting during the week of Montreal's International Jazz Festival. So, the city was buzzing, and every evening there was something perfect to do.
