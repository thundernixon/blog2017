I just got a message from a friend from my freshman year dormitory at the University of Minnesota.

> hey, i thought you would maybe be the guy to ask about this sort of thing. For a weird period every day, i'm a high school art teacher, and the first thing i'm doing is on hand-lettering. Wondering if you had any tips/links/etc about what a good place to start is, a fun structure for some unenthusiastic highschoolers, low floor/high ceiling projects, what kinds of pens i should buy (if any)... or anything else you think could be useful. Particularly the pens - the rest would be a bonus.

> Some parameters for my particular situation:  I have no meaningful art training, so anything I teach has to be something I can learn alongside students and get a sense of, and the budget is more-or-less limited to my willingness to buy things (I am willing to, but I imagine there are highly diminishing marginal returns at the top end of art supplies, and would like to avoid that where possible)


## First things first: some terminology

The German language has an all-encompassing word for designing with letters: _schrift_. English, however, doesn't technically have such a word (even though in casual converation, people tend to use the word _typography_). If you want to make things with letters, it's worth knowing the technical meaning of a few terms, so you can easily communicate with others about your goals and methods.

|Practice   | Definition  |
|---|---|
| Lettering  | Drawing letters as a specific composition  |
| Hand Lettering  | Lettering by hand  |
| Calligraphy  | _Writing_ letters in a decorative way, often in a specific composition  |
| Type Design  | Designing a system of letters (e.g. "type" or "fonts") to use in any combination  |
| Typography  | Using and organizing type to design  |

## 1. Check out some inspiration 

## 2. Tape any two pens together, and draw on any paper

## 3. Use a crayola marker for brush script

## 4. dig up some paintbrushes

## 5. "draw the skeleton" first
