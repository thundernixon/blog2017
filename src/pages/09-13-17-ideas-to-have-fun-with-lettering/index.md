I just got a message from a friend that from my freshman year dorm at the University of Minnesota.

> hey, this is a blast from the past but i thought you would maybe be the guy to ask about this sort of thing. For a weird period every day, i'm a high school art teacher, and the first thing i'm doing is on hand-lettering. Wondering if you had any tips/links/etc about what a good place to start is, a fun structure for some unenthusiastic highschoolers, low floor/high ceiling projects, what kinds of pens i should buy (if any)... or anything else you think could be useful. Particularly the pens - the rest would be a bonus. Thanks!


Hey, that's awesome! Well, the first thing you might try is calligraphy, rather than hand lettering, per se. Calligraphy is waaaay faster, and you can make something that looks cool without spending hours on it. 

For calligraphy, I recommend getting a few pilot parallel pens (the 6mm ones are the most fun, as they are the widest). It's nice to have some thick, smooth paper like Bristol, too, if there's the budget (printer paper will bleed and ruin the look somewhat). Also, showing them inspiration from people like Seb Lester and Luca Barcellona would probably be helpful. 

I would be happy to write more in a blog post. Would it work to have a better answer to you by Monday?

> Hey, thanks! I will look into calligraphy. I would love a blog post if you're willing to do it, or think you would enjoy making it. Some parameters for my particular situation, if you want to address it specifically, are that I have no meaningful art training, so anything I teach has to be something I can learn alongside students and get a sense of, and the budget is more-or-less limited to my willingness to buy things (I am willing to, but I imagine there are highly diminishing marginal returns at the top end of art supplies, and would like to avoid that where possible), but I'm sure the blog post becomes less useful for others the more specific it is to me...

## 1. Check out some inspiration 

## 2. Tape any two pens together, and draw on any paper

## 3. Use a crayola marker for brush script

## 4. dig up some paintbrushes

## 5. "draw the skeleton" first
