I just got a message from a friend from my freshman year dormitory at the University of Minnesota:

> hey, i thought you would maybe be the guy to ask about this sort of thing. For a weird period every day, i'm a high school art teacher, and the first thing i'm doing is on hand-lettering. Wondering if you had any tips/links/etc about what a good place to start is, a fun structure for some unenthusiastic highschoolers, low floor/high ceiling projects, what kinds of pens i should buy (if any)... or anything else you think could be useful. Particularly the pens - the rest would be a bonus. 
> 
> Some parameters for my particular situation:  I have no meaningful art training, so anything I teach has to be something I can learn alongside students and get a sense of, and the budget is more-or-less limited to my willingness to buy things (I am willing to, but I imagine there are highly diminishing marginal returns at the top end of art supplies, and would like to avoid that where possible)


## First things first: some terminology and a general approach

The German language has an all-encompassing word for designing with letters: _schrift_. English, however, doesn't technically have such a word (even though in casual converation, people tend to use the word _typography_). If you want to make things with letters, it's worth knowing the technical meaning of a few terms, so you can easily communicate with others about your goals and methods.

|Practice   | Definition  |
|---|---|
| Lettering  | Drawing letters as a specific composition  |
| Hand Lettering  | Lettering by hand  |
| Calligraphy  | _Writing_ letters in a decorative way, often in a specific composition  |
| Type Design  | Designing a system of letters (e.g. "type" or "fonts") to use in any combination  |
| Typography  | Using and organizing type to design  |

### Types of letterforms

When looking at example alphabets, it's useful to start to recognize what letterforms are made by what kind of tool. 

Once you know the type of writing tool, the next useful thing to think about is the "logic" of how that tool writes letters. Generally, downstrokes are thick, while upstrokes are thin. However, the specific stroke shapes will vary a lot between a flat pen, an "expansion" nibbed pen, and a brush.


The fastest way to understand this is to see a few videos of someone doing calligraphy. I'll mention a few more other inspiring letter-makers below, but take a look at Seb Lester – and pay close attention to the tools he is drawing with, to get a sense of how they influence the shapes that result.

## 1. Check out some inspiration & example alphabets

A simple and important way to learn about lettering is to copy example alphabets. You can either copy by eye – looking at the example, and reproducing it on a separate sheet of paper, or by tracing – maybe more useful if you're fairly new to studying letterforms, so you can get an understanding of the relationships between different shapes. One of the most famous books for this is The Speedball Textbook. It's been around for more than 100 years, and it's still a fantastic source of useful alphabets. It's available at many art stores and bookstores, and of course you can [get it on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Speedball-531791-Textbook-Centennial-Edition/dp/B018GJWEBO/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1505568499&sr=8-2&keywords=speedball+textbook), too.

If you're unable to buy a book and you have the time, you can also find some pretty great examples from the internet, and print them if you want. I don't feel comfortable posting or linking to any copywritten examples on my blog, but Pinterest and Flickr have a wealth of examples if you do a bit of digging.


### Pinterest

## 2. Trace, Trace, Trace – to learn and to iterate

## 3. Tape any two pens together, and draw on any paper

## 4. Use a crayola marker for brush script

## 5. "Draw the skeleton" of letters and compositions, then build on top
